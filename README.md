# Wavelet-Based-Biphase-Coherence-Wbiph-
Wavelet-Based Biphase Coherence (Wbiph) was proposed as an effective connectivity measure to improve classification performance in EEG studies. The experimental results suggested that Wbiph is better than the previous connectivity measures for classification in motor imagery and sleep.
